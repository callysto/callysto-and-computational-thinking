If you think of notebooks as ‚Äúprogrammable Word documents‚Äù the Callysto online service is your ‚Äúcomputer in the cloud.‚Äù In the next unit, we will explore how to sign into your Callysto account and make documents.

    "The second component is an **online library** of Jupyter notebooks for use in your classroom. These ‚Äúlearning modules‚Äù or notebooks act as interactive lesson plans or mini-textbooks for use in class, and often include graphics, animation, and live code.  They are ready-to-use and cover a wide range of topics for current curriculums.\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have broad applications in the classroom, the most prominent being the creation of assignments and interactive objects. Teachers can deliver self-contained assignments in which students can complete written sections, perform calculations, and submit their final work all within the same notebook. This helps teachers to follow their students‚Äô thought processes, assess their levels of understanding, and identify potential problem areas.\n",
