    "* Copying data from hockey stats website such as [hockey-reference.com](https://www.hockey-reference.com/) and pasting it into a spreadsheet\n",
    "* Making a graph from the tabular data\n",
    "* Using a word processor such as Microsoft Word or GoogleDoc to write a report based on the static snapshot of how that team was doing at that moment in time.\n",
    "* Copying the graph you made and pasting it into the report.\n",

    "- If using live data, you can design the document to remain relevant, even if you were to come back to the notebook next month or year\n",
    "* Create graphs directly inside the notebook\n",
