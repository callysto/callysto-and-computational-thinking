    "This is a more detailed list of instructions and can be considered an algorithm for making a scarf. Notice that some instructions basically say to do one thing (e.g grab your needles), while other instructions ask you to repeat some action (e.g. make 39 stitches. Or knit one, pearl two repeatedly to the end of the row). These repeated actions are examples of loops, which come up often in computer algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now using the keyword FOR to represent a loop in the knitting scarf algorithm we would have the following simplified notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather your two knitting needles and a large ball of wool.\n",
    "2. FOR 39 times repeat: cast a stitch on your needle to start the scarf.\n",

    "6. Sew in ends, wash gently by hand, block and let air dry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that step 5 in the algorithm above is still using the word <u> Repeat </u> instead of **FOR**. This is because **FOR**. to use FOR in this algorithm, we have to use a special notation called a “nested loop”. On a “nested loop” we put a loop inside another loop as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "### LOOPS and NESTED LOOPS\n",
    "Loops come up whenever an algorithm has to repeat some action over and over again. Additional examples of LOOPS include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When sorting books on a shelf in alphabetical order, you need to repeat the same action for each book over and over. \n",
    "- When baking a recipe, you need to add multiple cups of a specific ingredient. E.g. sugar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same thing happens with computer code. For instance, suppose you want to print 10 numbers, and their square. In human form, and computer form, you might write the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "|**Human Language**|**Computer Code**|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|On line one, print the answer to 1 times 1|print(1,1*1)|\n",

    "|On line three, print the answer to 3 times 3|print(3,3*3)|\n",
    "|On line four, print the answer to 4 times 4|print(4,4*4)|\n",

    "|On line six, print the answer to 6 times 6|print(6,6*6)|\n",
    "|On line seven, print the answer to 7 times 7|print(7,7*7)|\n",

    "|On line ten, print the answer to 10 times 10|print(10,10*10)|\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this gets dull really fast. A better way is to write a loop. A  “for” loop will work, like this:\n",

    "    FOR n in range(1,10):\n",
    "      print(n,n*n)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you are writing an algorithm but you need to represent two or more different options? In this case, the keyword **IF** becomes quite useful. **IF** is used when you want to write a <u> statement </u> or step to evaluate if a <u> condition </u>has been met. That’s why IF is also called a “conditional statement”.\n",
