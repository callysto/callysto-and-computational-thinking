    "In a way, the cook who follows a recipe is the hardware that runs the algorithm. Without the cook, nothing happens. Same thing with the computer hardware. Without the computer (with its keyboard and screen, its memory, and processor), nothing would happen. \n",

    "- If you think of the cook as “a computer,” her eyes and ears are input devices - like a computer camera and microphone.  Her voice and hands are output devices -- like the computer speaker, and maybe a robot arm. What is the cook’s memory unit? What is her “central processing unit?”\n",
    "- Is it possible that the cook’s brain has one part dedicated to memory, another part dedicated to following instructions?\n",
    "- A computer (or cook) might fail to complete a task because they miss a step in the algorithm. This could be because of an error in the software, or an error in the hardware. Can you describe what could cause these two types of errors?"
