Computational Thinking is key to this problem-solving process and can be described in the following steps:\n",

    "> Remove unnecessary detail from the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Format a general solution - design an algorithm**\n",
    "> Once the problem is broken down accordingly, take those pieces, solve them individually, and put them together logically into a complete solution (e.g. a process or set of rules) known in computer science as an algorithm.\n",
